# The Polygon Mesh Processing Library

The pmp-library is a modern C++ open-source library for digital geometry
processing. It provides a set of geometric data structures frequently used
in geometry processing tasks as well as implementations of canonical
algorithms. It has been designed and implemented with a focus on ease of
use and performance while maintaining high flexibility.

## Quickstart

Fetch the repository:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library.git

Configure and build:

    $ cd pmp-library
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

See the doc/installation.md file for the full installation guide.

## License

The pmp-library is provided under a flexible 3-clause
BSD [license](./LICENSE.txt), thereby allowing for both open-source and
commercial usage.
