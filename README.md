# The Polygon Mesh Processing Library

The pmp-library is a modern C++ open-source library for digital geometry
processing. It provides a set of geometric data structures frequently used
in geometry processing tasks as well as implementations of canonical
algorithms. It has been designed and implemented with a focus on ease of
use and performance while maintaining high flexibility.
