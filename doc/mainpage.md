# User Manual {#mainpage}

surface_mesh is a modern C++ open-source library for digital geometry processing. It
provides a set of geometric data structures frequently used in geometry
processing tasks as well as example implementations of canonical algorithms. It
has been designed and implemented with a focus on ease of use and performance
while maintaining high flexibility.

This manual is organized into the following sections:

- @subpage installation -- How compile and install surface_mesh
- @subpage quickstart -- How easily to setup your own project using surface_mesh
- @subpage overview -- An overview of the library components
- @subpage development -- Guidelines for surface_mesh development and contributions

The [Reference Manual](./annotated.html) provides detailed information on the
classes and functions provided by surface_mesh.

## Heritage

surface_mesh evolved from the `Surface_mesh` data structure developed by
the [Bielefeld Graphics & Geometry Group](http://graphics.uni-bielefeld.de),
which in turn was originally derived from [OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org).
