# User Manual {#mainpage}

The pmp-library is a modern C++ open-source library for digital geometry
processing. It provides a set of geometric data structures frequently used
in geometry processing tasks as well as implementations of canonical
algorithms. It has been designed and implemented with a focus on ease of
use and performance while maintaining high flexibility.

This manual is organized into the following sections:

- @subpage installation -- How compile and install pmp
- @subpage quickstart -- How easily to setup your own project using pmp
- @subpage overview -- An overview of the library components
- @subpage development -- Guidelines for pmp development and contributions

The [Reference Manual](./annotated.html) provides detailed information on the
classes and functions provided by pmp.

## Heritage

The pmp-library evolved from the `Surface_mesh` data structure developed by
the [Bielefeld Graphics & Geometry Group](http://graphics.uni-bielefeld.de),
which in turn was originally derived from [OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org).
